            ## ✅ Artifact Build Status

            All artifacts have been successfully built and validated from source modules.

            **Artifacts validated:**
            - `NF.jsonld` (schematic-compatible JSON-LD)
            - `dist/NF.yaml` (LinkML YAML)
            - `dist/NF.ttl` (Turtle RDF)
            - `registered-json-schemas/*.json` (Synapse JSON schemas)

            **Note:** Artifacts are not committed to this PR to avoid merge conflicts. All artifacts will be automatically rebuilt and committed to `main` after merge.
