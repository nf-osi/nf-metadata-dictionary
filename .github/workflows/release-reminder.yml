            ### Summary
            
            This issue helps ensure that at least one data model release is created monthly.

            ### Checklist

            - [ ] Review last schematic tests or test current state of data model on DCA staging 
            - [ ] Check if any other updates should be put into this release so they don't have to wait until the next
            - [ ] Create new release at https://github.com/nf-osi/nf-metadata-dictionary/releases
            - [ ] If new version affects user-facing templates*, update DCA production config downstream at https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/data_curator_config/tree/prod/NF-OSI

            * Occasionally, releases only include changes in draft templates or other non user-facing data model changes like mappings and comments.
