# When updates are merged into main, propagate data model updates to various places:
# 1. dcc-site uses assay, etc. for drop-down options; triggers a workflow in dcc-site that creates a PR to pull in new terms.
# 2. The Synapse schema registry has schemas for the NF entities such as portal studies and datasets. Push updated JSON schemas to the Synapse registry.
# 
# Highly related but to be handled by separate workflow:
# Update data model version in DCA-prod for official releases (instead of every merge into main)
