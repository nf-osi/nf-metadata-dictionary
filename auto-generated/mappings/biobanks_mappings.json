    "description": "[From JHU:] The Comprehensive Neurofibromatosis Center at Johns Hopkins serves a large volume of patients affected by NF1.  We have an IRB-approved research studyfor banking NF1-associated tumors including plexiform neurofibromas, MPNST, and blood fractions from patients with NF1.  We also collect and bank any malignancy from a patient with NF1 including breast cancer, GIST, and brain cancer. The goal of this project is to establish a comprehensively annotated biorepository of tissue and blood fractions for use in NF1 research.  Tumors included in our biospecimen bank include: cutaneous neurofibroma, diffuse infiltrating neurofibroma, plexiform neurofibroma, atypical neurofibroma, and MPNST.  Our goal is to increase availability of these tissues to the NF1 research community through scientific resource and data sharing."

The repository is built to support future research on tumor biomarkers as related to neurofibromas, their response to various treatments and pharmacodynamic dosing."
