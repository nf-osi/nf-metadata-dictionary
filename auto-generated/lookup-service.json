The goal of this project is to establish a comprehensively annotated biorepository of tissue and blood fractions for use in NF1 research.  Tumors included in our biospecimen bank include: cutaneous neurofibroma, diffuse infiltrating neurofibroma, plexiform neurofibroma, atypical neurofibroma, and MPNST.  Our goal is to increase availability of these tissues to the NF1 research community through scientific resource and data sharing."
