After bead-capture, the DNA is linearized via restriction enzymes, and can be sequenced using adapter primers facing in outward [reverse/forward (RF)] directions.  These library inserts are considered jumping because the ends originate from distal genomic DNA sequences and are ligated adjacent to one another during circularization.

These mutations are approximately 10 Mbp apart and may segregate independently of one another. Double heterozygotes survive an average of five months and exhibit a significant increase in the percentage of soft tissue sarcomas. About 30% of tumors from the Nf1/Trp53 cis animals stain positively for S100 (consistent with glial cell origin) and exhibit classic histological features of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). This strain may be useful in studies of astrocytomas/glioblastomas and tumor suppressor genes."

      Massive Soft Tissue Neurofibroma:
        description: Massive soft tissue neurofibroma is characterized  by local infiltration and extension to multiple nerve branches,  as well as substantial overgrowth of adjacent soft tissue and  skin, which distinguishes it from its more benign variant, plexiform neurofibroma. With striking presentation and  severe dysmorphism, massive soft tissue neurofibroma is also labeled elephantiasis neuromatosa. Although considered benign it  shares similarities with malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumors such as local infiltration and cell mitogenesis. Massive soft tissue neurofibroma is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and almost no response to  conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Surgery is eventually pursued, although bleeding may be a life-threatening  complication as massive soft tissue neurofibromas are highly  vascularized.
