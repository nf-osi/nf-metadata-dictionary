This technique is used to study how a cell responds when electric current enters a cell; this is important for instance for understanding how neurons respond to neurotransmitters that act by opening membrane ion channels.

After bead-capture, the DNA is linearized via restriction enzymes, and can be sequenced using adapter primers facing in outward [reverse/forward (RF)] directions.  These library inserts are considered jumping because the ends originate from distal genomic DNA sequences and are ligated adjacent to one another during circularization.

With striking presentation and  severe dysmorphism, massive soft tissue neurofibroma is also labeled elephantiasis neuromatosa. Although considered benign it  shares similarities with malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumors such as local infiltration and cell mitogenesis. Massive soft tissue neurofibroma is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and almost no response to  conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Surgery is eventually pursued, although bleeding may be a life-threatening  complication as massive soft tissue neurofibromas are highly  vascularized.

  PortalStudy:
    description: >
      A scientific project of some planned duration with PIs and key contributors, specific research topics, and potential publication/data/other outputs.  A study is often represented as a Synapse project and so is also referred to as "project". The study schema here is specifically for studies listed on the NF Portal at https://nf.synapse.org/Explore/Studies.

    notes:
      - There are small differences for the public portal representation of study vs. elsewhere such as in the less-public data sharing plan, but it should always be possible to translate DSP rep to the portal study rep.
