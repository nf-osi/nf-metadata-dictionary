"individualID","A unique identifier (non-PII) that represents the individual from which the data came. This could be a patient or animal ID.","true","#"
"platform","A sequencing platform, microscope, spectroscope/plate reader, or other platform for collecting data.","true","#PlatformEnum"
"resourceType","The type of resource being stored and annotated","true","#Resource"
"species","The name of a species (typically a taxonomic group) of organism.","true","#SpeciesEnum"
"specimenID","A unique identifier (non-PII) that represents the subspecimen (subsample) from which the data came,  e.g. an ID that distinguishes between different parts of the same parent tumor specimen.
