"fileFormat","Defined format of the data file, typically corresponding to extension, but sometimes indicating more general group of files produced by the same tool or software","true","#FileFormatEnum"
"individualID","A unique identifier (non-PII) that represents the individual from which the data came. This could be a patient or animal ID.","true","#"
"platform","A sequencing platform, microscope, spectroscope/plate reader, or other platform for collecting data.","true","#PlatformEnum"
"resourceType","The type of resource being stored and annotated","true","#Resource"
"species","The name of a species (typically a taxonomic group) of organism.","true","#SpeciesEnum"
