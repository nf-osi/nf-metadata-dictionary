"dataType","A type of data -- experimental, clinical, or other. Most typically refers to a high-level data type that can be related to an assay type.  For example, a file of dataType `genomicVariants` might have an assay value of `whole genome sequencing`.
","true","#Data|#Metadata"
"fileFormat","Defined format of the data file, typically corresponding to extension, but sometimes indicating more general group of files produced by the same tool or software","true","#FileFormatEnum"
"individualID","A unique identifier (non-PII) that represents the individual from which the data came. This could be a patient or animal ID.","true","#"
"platform","A sequencing platform, microscope, spectroscope/plate reader, or other platform for collecting data.","true","#PlatformEnum"
"resourceType","The type of resource being stored and annotated","true","#Resource"
"species","The name of a species (typically a taxonomic group) of organism.","true","#SpeciesEnum"
"specimenID","A unique identifier (non-PII) that represents the subspecimen (subsample) from which the data came,  e.g. an ID that distinguishes between different parts of the same parent tumor specimen.

"ageUnit","A time unit that can be used with a given age value, e.g. years.","false","#TimeUnit"
