"progressReportNumber","Indicates milestone the  data is associated with. Currently only required for projects funded by NTAP, GFF, and NFRI. For GFF studies, this is the ‘progress report’ timeline. Example: if submitting data for the 6-month milestone report for NTAP, progressReportNumber=1.  Also if submitting data associated with first milestone, progressReportNumber =1","optional","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Not Applicable",""
