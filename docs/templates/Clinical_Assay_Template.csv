"Filename","The name of the file. ","required","","Automatically filled when using the curator app."
"progressReportNumber","Indicates milestone the  data is associated with. Currently only required for projects funded by NTAP, GFF, and NFRI. For GFF studies, this is the ‘progress report’ timeline. Example: if submitting data for the 6-month milestone report for NTAP, progressReportNumber=1.  Also if submitting data associated with first milestone, progressReportNumber =1","optional","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Not Applicable",""

"assay","The technology used to generate the data in this file","required","#Assay",""
"platform","A sequencing platform, microscope, spectroscope/plate reader, or other platform for collecting data. ","optional","#Platform",""
"individualID","A unique identifier (non-PII) that represents the individual from which the data came. This could be a patient or animal ID. ","optional","","Typically annotated with a single ID, but many allowed for, e.g. a clinical dataset that contains endpoint data for an entire cohort."
"specimenID","A unique identifier (non-PII) that represents the specimen (sample) from which the data came. e.g. an ID that indicates a specific tumor specimen.","optional","","Typically annotated with a single ID, but many allowed for summary data."
"sex","Phenotypic expression of chromosomal makeup that defines a study subject as male, female, or other.","optional","#Sex",""
"species","The name of a species (typically a taxonomic group) of organism.","optional","#Species",""
"diagnosis","A diagnosis is the result of a medical investigation to identify a disorder from its signs and symptoms.","optional","#Diagnosis","Currently a single NF diagnosis allowed; in the future multiple diagnoses may be allowed for comorbidities."
