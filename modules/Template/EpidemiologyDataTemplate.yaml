          The current clamp technique records the membrane potential by injecting current into a cell through the recording electrode.

This technique is used to study how a cell responds when electric current enters a cell; this is important for instance for understanding how neurons respond to neurotransmitters that act by opening membrane ion channels.

After bead-capture, the DNA is linearized via restriction enzymes, and can be sequenced using adapter primers facing in outward [reverse/forward (RF)] directions.  These library inserts are considered jumping because the ends originate from distal genomic DNA sequences and are ligated adjacent to one another during circularization.

    - There are small differences for the public portal representation of study vs.
      elsewhere such as in the less-public data sharing plan, but it should always
      be possible to translate DSP rep to the portal study rep.
