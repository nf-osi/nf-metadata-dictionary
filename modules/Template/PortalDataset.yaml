      accessType:
        description: Access type label. Most datasets are public access or controlled access -- on Synapse, this can be distinguished via https://rest-docs.synapse.org/rest/GET/entity/id/accessRequirement.html, and if the ARs include the ACTAccessRequirement type, then it is controlled access (other ARs like Self-signedAR are not considered controlled access). When datasets are catalogued from other repositories, controlled access is translated/interpreted using that repo's methods. Note that even if only one part of the dataset is controlled access, the dataset should be considered controlled access.

    notes:
    - The compiled JSON schema for this should be bound to [Dataset](https://rest-docs.synapse.org/rest/org/sagebionetworks/repo/model/table/Dataset.html) entities, not folders.
    - While "publisher" (repository) may seem redundant given that all Datasets are obviously on Synapse, it's for explicit compatibility with DataCite, and eventually may want to have "symbolic" datasets like Cancer Complexity Portal that list datasets hosted somewhere else.
