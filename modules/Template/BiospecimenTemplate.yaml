      Massive Soft Tissue Neurofibroma:
        description: Massive soft tissue neurofibroma is characterized  by local infiltration
          and extension to multiple nerve branches,  as well as substantial overgrowth
          of adjacent soft tissue and  skin, which distinguishes it from its more
          benign variant, plexiform neurofibroma. With striking presentation and  severe
          dysmorphism, massive soft tissue neurofibroma is also labeled elephantiasis
          neuromatosa. Although considered benign it  shares similarities with malignant
          peripheral nerve sheath  tumors such as local infiltration and cell mitogenesis.
          Massive soft tissue neurofibroma is associated with significant morbidity
          and mortality and almost no response to  conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
          Surgery is eventually pursued, although bleeding may be a life-threatening  complication
          as massive soft tissue neurofibromas are highly  vascularized.
