  AccessTypeEnum:
    notes:
    - Historically has been used with `accessTeam` especially if "PRIVATE".
    - All files have to qualify to be labeled as such, e.g. a single Controlled Access file will make the dataset Controlled Access.
    - This is not personalized to the user. They will have to evaluate it from their perspective, we are not dynamically rendering this.
    - See also https://github.com/PAIR-code/datacardsplaybook/blob/main/templates/DataCardsExtendedTemplate.md#access-type
