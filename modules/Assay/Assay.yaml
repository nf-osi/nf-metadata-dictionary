      sandwich ELISA:
        description: The sandwich ELISA measures the amount of antigen between two layers of antibodies.

Sandwich ELISAs for quantitation of antigens are especially valuable when the concentration of antigens is low and/or they are contained in high concentrations of contaminating protein.
