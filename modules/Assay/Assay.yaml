          The size-selected fragments are ligated to adapters for bead-capture and circularized. After bead-capture, the DNA is linearized via restriction enzymes, and can be sequenced using adapter primers facing in outward [reverse/forward (RF)] directions. 
          These library inserts are considered jumping because the ends originate from distal genomic DNA sequences and are ligated adjacent to one another during circularization.
