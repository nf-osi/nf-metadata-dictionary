        meaning: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C122930
      twin spot assay:
        description: Two individual and genetically different populations of cells that originate from the same mitotic recombination event; twin spots allow a direct and reliable comparison between mutant and wild-type clones, and the size of the wild-type twin can serve as a reference for comparison with the homozygous mutant clones.

      ultra high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry:
        description: UPLC-MSMS is an analytical technique wherein ultra-high performance liquid chromatography is coupled to tandem mass spectrometry in order to separate, identify, and quantify substances in a sample.

      whole exome sequencing:
        description: A procedure that can determine the DNA sequence for all of the exons in an individual.
        meaning: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C101295
      whole genome sequencing:
        description: Laboratory technique to sequence the complete DNA sequence of an organism's genome at a single time

      whole-cell patch clamp:
        description: A patch-clamp assay where the electrode is left in place on the cell, as in cell-attached recordings, but the membrane patch has been perforated, providing access from the interior of the pipette to the intracellular space of the cell. Measurements made with this technique involve recording currents through multiple channels simultaneously, over the membrane of the entire cell.

      word recognition score:
        description: Assays how well a person can understand speech by repeating a list of words. The WRS is a percentage of words correctly repeated. It's a more functional measure because it predicts whether hearing loss can be improved with amplification.
      STR profile:
        description: The analysis of all of the short tandem repeats in the genome of a biological sample.
