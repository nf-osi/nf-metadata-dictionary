      Massive Soft Tissue Neurofibroma:
        description: Massive soft tissue neurofibroma is characterized  by local infiltration and extension to multiple nerve branches,  as well as substantial overgrowth of adjacent soft tissue and  skin, which distinguishes it from its more benign variant, plexiform neurofibroma. With striking presentation and  severe dysmorphism, massive soft tissue neurofibroma is also labeled elephantiasis neuromatosa. Although considered benign it  shares similarities with malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumors such as local infiltration and cell mitogenesis. Massive soft tissue neurofibroma is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and almost no response to  conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Surgery is eventually pursued, although bleeding may be a life-threatening  complication as massive soft tissue neurofibromas are highly  vascularized.
