    permissible_values:
      Neurofibromatosis type 1:
        description: >
          (NF1) - A disease characterized by patches of skin pigmentation (cafe-au-lait spots), Lisch nodules of the iris, tumors in the peripheral nervous system and fibromatous skin tumors. 
          Individuals with the disorder have increased susceptibility to the development of benign and malignant tumors.
      #Neurofibromatosis type 2:
      #  description: > 
      #    (NF2) - Genetic disorder characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas (formerly called acoustic neuromas), schwannomas of other cranial and peripheral nerves, meningiomas, and ependymomas. 
      #    It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with full penetrance.

        meaning: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0014299
      22q-related schwannomatosis:
        description: >
          A schwannomatosis that causes a predisposition to develop multiple schwannoma. It is diagnosed when an individual does not meet criteria for NF2-related schwannomatosis, SMARCB1-related schwannomatosis, or LTZR1-related schwannomatosis and both of the following molecular features exist: a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the same chromosome 22q markers in two anatomically distinct tumors or hybrid nerve sheath tumors and a different NF2 pathogenic variant in each tumor which cannot be detected in unaffected tissue.
        meaning: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_1030016
      Schwannomatosis-NOS:
        description: Schwannomatosis, not otherwise specified. Used when the specific genetic cause or subtype cannot be determined or is not available.
      Schwannomatosis-NEC:
        description: Schwannomatosis, not elsewhere classified. Used for cases that do not fit into other established diagnostic categories.
      Sporadic Schwannoma:
        description: >
          Sporadic schwannomas and neurofibromas are tumors that arise from the nerve sheaths of cranial nerves, nerve roots, spinal nerves, and peripheral nerves. 
          Most schwannomas originate from the eighth cranial nerve, whereas neurofibromas more commonly arise along the spinal nerve roots.
