      Neurofibromatosis type 1:
        description: >
          (NF1) - A disease characterized by patches of skin pigmentation (cafe-au-lait spots), Lisch nodules of the iris, tumors in the peripheral nervous system and fibromatous skin tumors. 
          Individuals with the disorder have increased susceptibility to the development of benign and malignant tumors.
      #Neurofibromatosis type 2:
      #  description: > 
      #    (NF2) - Genetic disorder characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas (formerly called acoustic neuromas), schwannomas of other cranial and peripheral nerves, meningiomas, and ependymomas. 
      #    It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with full penetrance.

      Sporadic Schwannoma:
        description: >
          Sporadic schwannomas and neurofibromas are tumors that arise from the nerve sheaths of cranial nerves, nerve roots, spinal nerves, and peripheral nerves. 
          Most schwannomas originate from the eighth cranial nerve, whereas neurofibromas more commonly arise along the spinal nerve roots.
