# Modules are not orthogonal
# Assays are related to sample, experiment design, output data, etc.


# Assay module: Attributes and values that describe some assay
Assay:
  - name: Assay
    src: Assay/Assay.csv  # value range for `assay`
  - name: Platform
    src: Assay/Platform.csv # value range for `platform`
  - name: Method
    src: Assay/Method.csv # value range for `platform`
  - name: Assay_Parameter
    src: Assay/Assay_Parameter # value range for `platform`

# Data module: Attributes and values that describe data entities
Data:
  - name: File Format
    src: Data/File_Format.csv # value range for `fileFormat`
  - name: Data Class
    src: Data/Data_Class.csv  # value range for `dataType`
  - name: Data Level
    src: Data/Data_Level.csv # value range for `dataSubtype`
  - name: Resource
    src: Data/Resource.csv # value range for `resourceType`

# Experiment module: Attributes and values that describe experiment design
# Things like "timepoints" and "targets" also make more sense with certain assays
# In fact, assay is really part of the experiment design
  - name: Unit
    src: Experiment/Unit.csv  # can also be in Data/ as well, really
  - name: Method
    src: Experiment/Method.csv  # can also be in Data/ as well, really

# Sample module: Attributes and values that describe sample inputs to an assay
  # sample types
Sample:
  - name: Cell 
    src: Sample/Cell.csv  # value range for `cellType`
  - name: Cell_Line_Model
    src: Sample/Cell_Line_Model.csv   # value range for `modelSystemName`
  - name: Mouse_Model
    src: Sample/Mouse_Model.csv # value range for `modelSystemName`
  - name: Tissue
    src: Sample/Tissue.csv  # value range for `tissueType`
  - name: Tumor
    src: Sample/Tumor.csv  # value range for `tumorType`
  - name: Material # inorganic samples
    src: Sample/Material.csv
  # inherent characteristics of a sample
  - name: Body Part
    src: Sample/Body_Part.csv 
  - name: Species
    src: Sample/Species.csv 
  - name: Genotype
    src: Sample/Genotype.csv 
  - name: Sex
    src: Sample/Sex.csv 
  # processing of sample -- perhaps belongs more in Assay than or Experiment than Sample
  - name: Specimen Processing
    src: Sample/Specimen_Processing.csv 
  # processing of sample
  - name: Specimen State
    src: Sample/Specimen_State.csv
