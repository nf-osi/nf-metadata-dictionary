title: Mapping of legacy `dataType` concept labels present in v193- v194 of Portal - Files to new preferred labels in data model v10.01.0.
description: This translates concept terms in use to new preferred labels in data model v10.01.0. (Only terms being translated are included.)
mapping:
  - source: Administrative Metadata
    target:
      label: metadata
  
  - source: AggregatedData
    target:
      label: epidemiological data
      comment: Aggregated data noted as not a preferred term for curation. Inspection of 4 files with this annotation suggested new term "epidemiological data" as more useful.
