After bead-capture, the DNA is linearized via restriction enzymes, and can be sequenced using adapter primers facing in outward [reverse/forward (RF)] directions.  These library inserts are considered jumping because the ends originate from distal genomic DNA sequences and are ligated adjacent to one another during circularization.\n"
