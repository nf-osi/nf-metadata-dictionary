          injecting current into a cell through the recording electrode.  Unlike in
          the voltage clamp mode, where the membrane potential is held at a level
          determined by the experimenter, in "current clamp" mode the membrane potential
          is free to vary,  and the amplifier records whatever voltage the cell generates
          on its own or as a result of stimulation.  This technique is used to study
          how a cell responds when electric current enters a cell; this is important
          for instance for understanding how neurons respond to neurotransmitters
          that act by opening membrane ion channels.
